Task Tracker (MEAN stack)
=======================

This app consists of two parts:

1. Admin
2. Users

Admin can view the tasks added by all the users (but cannot edit them).

User can only login using Facebook Auth. Users can add, edit and delete tasks **only** for the same day. Although, a history of past tasks can be seen.
